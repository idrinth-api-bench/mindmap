# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The current version is always the one being supported for security and bugfixes. Changes to older versions will not happen, due to time restrictions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this tool is not a tool, that should be accessible to the public, security issues should be limited in scope. Feel free to open an issue if you find any.
